Azure AI Custom Vision is transforming wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts by enabling the automatic identification of animal species from images. By using custom models trained on labeled data, Azure can differentiate between various animal species, whether in remote habitats or local environments. This technology is a powerful tool for conservationists, researchers, and ecotourism industries to track endangered species, monitor biodiversity, and educate the public.

The process is simple: upload labeled images, train the model, and integrate it into a web application. By using Python Flask for the app and Azure App Service for deployment, developers can easily create real-time applications for species identification. This guide covers the steps from data preparation to model deployment, making it easy for anyone to harness the power of AI for environmental research and conservation.
